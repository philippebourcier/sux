  The main idea is to replace "... | sort | uniq -c [ | sort -(r)(n) ] [ | head -N ]"
  This program is faster and less memory consuming than the above commands.

  Sample use:

   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head -n 20
   will be replaced by:
   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sux -rn 20

   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sort | uniq -c | sort -n
   will be replaced by:
   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sux -s

   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sort | uniq -c
   will be replaced by:
   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sux

   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sort | uniq -c | head -n 20
   will be replaced by:
   # cat file.txt | awk ... | sux -n 20
